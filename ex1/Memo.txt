gradient descent:

theta  = like an array with [0;0]

start putting data into it.
since Octave array starts from ONE, the index for this array will start from 1.

alpha is learning rate

X = data(:, 1); y = data(:, 2);


  %video : Gradient Descent 9:00: correct: simultaneous update
    % this time from 1, not 0
    % sum is the best way to avoid loop
    % X,y,theta are all column vector with 2 elements
